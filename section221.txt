2.2.1 Eddy Covariance (EC) method
To evaluate the daily evaporation rate, the EC method (Burga et al., 2006) was applied. To H2O density was measured  with the integrated Open-Path Gas Analyzer and 3-D Sonic Anemometer IRGASON installed on the coast of the Priyadarshini lake (gauge EV in Fig. ). The calibration of the instrument was done 21.08.2017 in the lab of the Finnish Meteorological Institute with standard zero-and-span procedure (the gain factor for the calibration). To process raw data coming from the Irgason the following steps were done: the humidity correction of the sonic temperature (REF), the data filtering and quality control, the flux calculations and the “after flux” analysis. 

The humidity correction of the air temperature was done according to equation 1 (REF): see Equations.pdf

The evaporation rate was calculated for 30 minute intervals using the dataset filtered within two steps. First the time intervals covered by less than 50 % of total measurements (equals to 18000 for the measurement rate of 10 Hz) were excluded. Then, we flagged the data with non zero values in the flags of the sonic and gas analysers and with the H2O signal strength less then 0.7. The flagged measuments were rejected in futher analasis. The data quality control was performed by the number of the intervals rejected during the first step of the filtering  and by the percentage of the data accepted after the filtering within each 30 min interval. The evaporation rater was calculated for each interval only in the case if the measurements cover more than ¼ of total measurements.

After flagging, the despiking procedure was applied for the wind components and H2O density values to remove exteme peaks from the measuments as suggested by (REF). then, the detrending procedure was done following to (REF).
